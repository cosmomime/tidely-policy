    <h1>Privacy Policy for Tidely</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: 15 January 2026</p>

    <p>At Tidely, accessible from within the Tidely mobile application, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Tidely and how we use it.</p>

    <h2>1. Local Data Storage (Offline-First)</h2>
    <p>Tidely is an offline-first application. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All your personal entries, tasks, categories, and mood selections are stored locally on your device's internal database.</li>
        <li>All media attachments (images, videos, and audio files) are stored in your device's local storage.</li>
        <li>We do not have a server, and we do not transmit your personal data to any external servers. We cannot see, access, or modify your content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not require you to create an account or provide an email address to use the core features of the app. Your data stays with you.</p>
    <p><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> If you purchase a premium subscription, the transaction is processed by the Google Play Store. We receive a confirmation of payment and a non-identifiable purchase token to activate your features. We do not collect your name, credit card information, or billing address.</p>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>To provide its features, Tidely requires the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Media/Storage:</strong> To allow you to pick and display photos, videos, and audio files in your entries.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To provide reminders for your scheduled tasks and entries.</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Used only if you choose to record audio notes within the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Deletion and Portability</h2>
    <p><strong>Deletion:</strong> You have full control over your data. You can delete individual entries or media files within the app. To delete all data associated with the app, you can clear the App Data in your device settings or uninstall the application.</p>
    <p><strong>Portability:</strong> You can use the "Export" feature within the app to create a backup file of your data. This data is handled entirely by you.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Information</h2>
    <p>Tidely does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our App, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best to promptly remove such information from our records.</p>
